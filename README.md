# Airflow + DBT + Snowflake ELT Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete modular ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline using Apache Airflow, dbt, and Snowflake. The pipeline automates raw data staging, transformation, and testing using dbt models orchestrated by Airflow DAGs.
- **Airflow** for scheduling and DAG orchestration
- **DBT** for modular SQL-based transformations and testing
- **Snowflake** as the cloud data warehouse
